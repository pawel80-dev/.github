## CV extension


**Repos and some notes**

Since a CV offers limited space to showcase my coding skills, I've included several code sample repositories on GitHub.  

> [!NOTE]
> For most of my projects, the leading branch is the **dev** one. That means that *_dev.yaml file is the most frequently used workflow/pipeline.
